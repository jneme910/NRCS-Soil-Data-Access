---SOC
---Soil organic carbon stock estimate (SOC) in total soil profile (0 cm to the reported depth of the soil profile). The concentration of organic carbon present in the soil expressed in grams C per square meter for the total reported soil profile depth. NULL values are presented where data are incomplete or not available.

---Uses all components with horizon data.
---Does not calculate component SOC below the following component restrictions:
---Lithic bedrock, Paralithic bedrock, Densic bedrock, Fragipan, Duripan, Sulfuric
---
----soc =  ( (hzT * ( ( om / 1.724 ) * db3 )) / 100.0 ) * ((100.0 - fragvol) / 100.0) * ( compPct * 100 )
