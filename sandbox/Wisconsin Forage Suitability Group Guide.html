<p>The Soil Map Units in each county are assigned to a pasture state of an ecological site according to their suitability for hay land and pasture management.</p>

<p>Many different Hay and Pasture Plants are commonly used in Wisconsin, each of these plants will have different responses to various soil characteristics.  The pasture suitability groups provide a general means of selecting the pasture or hayland plants best suited to a site, and a relative means of estimating potential productivity.</p>

<p>The soil characteristics used to group the soils are: Available Water Capacity (AWC), Drainage Class, and Runoff potential.  Soil Temperature Regime is used as a modifier.  Many other characteristics of soils that may have an impact on plant adaptability and performance were not considered.</p>

<p>The table below provides the placement of each soil in its assigned forage suitability group.  Specific concerns and recommendations for pasture and hayland management for each group are described in the following paragraphs.</p>

<p>Group 1.  These soils have low AWC, but also have a high seasonal water table in the spring and the fall.  They are generally sandy with imperfect drainage.  These soils will tend to be too wet at some periods of the year, and too dry at others.  Recommended forage mixtures are those that include Kentucky Bluegrass, Timothy, Alsike or Ladino Clovers, or Trefoil.  Relative production level is low, 1 to 2 Tons per acre/year.</p>

<p>Group 2.  These soils have low AWC, and do not have a seasonal water table in the upper part of the profile.  They are generally sandy with adequate drainage.  These soils will tend to be droughty during mid-season in most years.  Recommended forage mixtures are those that include Kentucky Bluegrass, Orchardgrass, and Alsike or Ladino Clovers.  Relative production level is low, 1 to 2 Tons per acre/year.</p>

<p>Group 3.  These soils have low AWC, and do not have a seasonal water table in the upper part of the profile.  They are generally sandy with adequate drainage.  Runoff potential, Slope, Aspect, and Erosion are all concerns on these soils.  These soils will tend to be droughty during mid-season in most years.  Recommended forage mixtures are those that include Kentucky Bluegrass, Orchardgrass, and Alsike or Ladino Clovers.  Relative production level is low, 1 to 2 Tons per acre/year.</p>

<p>Group 4.  These soils have moderate AWC, with water tables at or near the surface especially in the spring and fall.  They are generally loams with imperfect drainage.  These soils will tend to be excessively wet during some period of the year.  Recommended forage mixtures are those that include Kentucky Bluegrass, Timothy, Alsike or Ladino Clovers, or Trefoil.  Relative production is Moderately Low, 1.5 to 2.5 Tons per acre/year.</p>

<p>Group 5.  These soils have moderate AWC, and no water table in the upper part of the profile.  They are generally loams with adequate drainage.  These soils may be droughty in mid-season in some years.  Recommended forage mixtures are those that include Kentucky Bluegrass, Timothy, Orchardgrass, Bromegrass, Red Clover, Alsike or Ladino Clover, Alfalfa, or Trefoil.  Relative production is Moderately High, 3.5 to 4.5 Tons per acre/year.</p>

<p>Group 6.  These soils have moderate AWC, and no water table in the upper part of the profile.  They are generally loams with adequate drainage.  Runoff potential, Slope, Aspect, and Erosion are all concerns on these soils.  These soils may be droughty in mid-season in some years.  Recommended forage mixtures are those that include Kentucky Bluegrass, Timothy, Orchardgrass, Bromegrass, Red Clover, Aslike or Ladino Clover, Alfalfa, or Trefoil.  Relative production is Moderately High, 3.5 to 4.5 Tons per acre/year.</p>

<p>Group 7.  These soils have high AWC, with water tables at or near the surface especially in the spring and fall.  They are generally Silt Loam or Loam with imperfect drainage.  These soils will tend to be excessively wet during some period of the year.  Some of these soils may be subject to flooding of short duration.  Recommended forage mixtures are those that include Kentucky Bluegrass, Timothy, Alsike or Ladino Clovers, or Trefoil.  Relative production is Moderate, 2.0 to 3.0 Tons per acre/year.</p>

<p>Group 8.  These soils have high AWC, and no water table in the upper part of the profile.  They are generally Silt Loam or Loam with adequate drainage.  These soils have few impediments to pasture production.  Recommended forage mixtures are those that include Kentucky Bluegrass, Timothy, Orchardgrass, Bromegrass, Red Clover, Alsike or Ladino Clover, Alfalfa, or Trefoil.  Relative production is High, 4.0 to 5.0 Tons per acre/year.</p>

<p>Group 9.  These soils have high AWC, and no water table in the upper part of the profile.  They are generally Silt Loam or Loam with adequate drainage.  Runoff potential, Slope, Aspect, and Erosion are all concerns on these soils.  Recommended forage mixtures are those that include Kentucky Bluegrass, Timothy, Orchardgrass, Bromegrass, Red Clover, Alsike or Ladino Clover, Alfalfa, or Trefoil.  Relative production is High, 4.0 to 5.0 Tons per acre/year.</p>


<p>Group 10.  These soils have high AWC, and water tables at or above the surface for much of the year.  These soils are characterized by surface layers of Organic material 16 or more inches thick.  These soils are subject to severe Ponding or Flooding, or both.  Where used for grazing, season of use may be very restrictive.  Most of these sites are not planted to forages, with grazing occurring on the existing vegetation.  Relative production is variable, depending on the forages present, and length of season, but are generally Low, 1.0 to 2.0 Tons per acre/year.</p>

<b>
<p>NORTHERN SOILS</p>
</b>

<p>The group descriptions provided are for soils occurring in the Mesic Soil Temperature Regime area of Wisconsin.  Soils occurring in the Frigid Soil Temperature Regime of Wisconsin will have the following considerations</p>
<ul>
<li>Growing Season length will be shorter, so all relative production levels should be reduced by a half a Ton/acre.</li>
<li>	Soils in Group 10 are generally not used for pasture in the Northern portion of the state due to short frost free periods, and wetness.</li>
<li>Drought restriction may be less severe on Northern soils due to the relatively lower temperatures, and reduced evapotranspiration.</li>
<li>	Wetness restriction may be more severe on Northern soils due to the relatively lower temperatures, and reduced evapotranspiration.</li>
<li>	Soil P.H. is generally lower in Northern Wisconsin, and should be considered in forage selection.  Pasture and Hayland management plans should consider the need for P.H. adjustment.</li>
</ul>
