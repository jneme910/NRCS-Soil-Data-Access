		<h3>Soil Data Access (SDA) Farmland Protection Policy Act-LESA Using Commodity Crop Productivity Index (Corn) (WI) </h3>
	<p>
	An SDA-populated select list is used to pick a state and SSA which enables creation of a "Farmland Protection Policy Act - LESA" based upon those selections using the WI-CCPI. The data is not static; it hits Soil Data Access Live. To reset the table hit F5 on the keyboard. Once a survey is selected and table appears, if a new survey is selected it will append to the table at the bottom. Note: this report takes a few seconds longer to run. If the table doesn't appear right away please be patient.

</li>
<li>
LE (land evaluation) part of LESA - site assessment (as per the name) must be done on a site. Specific basis since it includes things like Ag infrastructure etc.. AND FPPA
</li>
</ul>

<p> The primary need for a LESA System in the state is for use in ranking soil survey map units to make farmland suitability assessments for the Farmland Protection Policy Act (FPPA). Prior to this new system, ranking sheets that were developed for soil survey legends that were available in the early 80's have been used for this purpose. Problems with these ranking sheets were that many Wisconsin soil survey legends have been completed or updated since that time, and the ranking sheets had not been updated with the new soil survey legend information. As such, the 30 year old ranking sheets have gaps in the data and no longer agree with the current, official soil survey data that are currently presented on the Web Soil Survey. In addition, the ranking sheets utilized crop yield estimates from the original soil surveys as part of the ranking criteria. Over the years, those crop yield data have not been updated to reflect current improvements in crop genetics and agricultural practices, so the yield estimates are now very dated and inconsistent Statewide.
</p>
<p>This new Statewide LESA System corrects these deficiencies in the old ranking sheets. It utilizes a crop suitability ranking index that was developed for soils which is based on the soil properties in the official soil survey database, rather than the stored crop yield estimates. In addition, it is run on the same official soil survey data that are used by the Web Soil Survey. As such, it can provide a consistent, science based agricultural suitability ranking for soils of Wisconsin which can be refreshed very quickly as the official soil survey data are updated annually.
	</p>
<p>	
The new Statewide LESA System assigns the official map units for each Soil Survey Area into one of 20 groupings, with group one being the map units in the soil survey area with the best suitability for agricultural land uses, and group 20 being the least suited. The groupings are generated independently for each soil survey area so that each area will have some map unit(s) in the highest group and some map unit(s) in the lowest group. This remains consistent with the method that was used on the original ranking sheets. Each group is then assigned a relative value (rv) number which is 100 for group 1, 0 for groups 17 through 20, and increments between 0 and 100 for all other groups. These "RV" numbers are used to calculate rankings for the FPPA evaluations.
