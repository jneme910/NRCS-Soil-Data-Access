The overnight delay is an artifact of a performance tradeoff. The changes that are made via the Rule and Report manager go into an "online" database that allows read and write access. Each night a "snapshot" is made to create a read-only copy that is used by WSS, which only ready from the database. During the snapshot process all users are disconnected, hence the snapshot is taken only once per day (at around midnight Central time or thereabouts). Using this mode of access permits much faster database access for concurrent access for all of our users - the underlying SQL Server engine does not need to lock rows, pages or tables to unsure database consistency. Between WSS and Soil Data Access we place a good load on the SQL Server environment, especially for spatial operations, so we're always on the look-out for performance improvements, even if there are some trade-offs.
